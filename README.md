## How to Install

If you have already install a previous version (3.3.3 or lower) of admob, you will see two extension in "Settings->Extensions". This is because of the renamed folder you just downloaded from GitHub.
If this is your case, do the following:

- Enable the Admob Extension thats not enabled (press green button "Enable")
- Disable the Admob Extension thats not disabled (press red button "Disable")
- Close your Game
- Go to "YOURDOCUMENTFOLDER/stencylworks/engine-extensions/" folder
- Delete the folder "admob" and leave the folder "admob-master"(thats the new folder name)
- Open you Game
- You see can in Settings->Extensions, there is now jus one Admob extension.
- The blocks you already used with previous version subsist.

Or for advanced users:(Not recommended)
- Unzip admob-master.zip you just download
- Rename folder from "admob-master" to "admob"
- Copy the admob folder and paste it in "YOURDOCUMENTFOLDER/stencylworks/engine-extensions/"
- You have to do this every time you download a updated version fom GitHub.
